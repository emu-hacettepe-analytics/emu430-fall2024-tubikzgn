Another thing that is mentioned in the video was to have a very well-defined problem is very crucial for deploying our models and starting to a new project. To improve our pieces of software, actively listening to the end user is very important. They are right most times. So we need to adjust our software according to the end user. And data science may seem like you need to do hard programming, but this is a misleading concept because most of the time you deal with other dirty jobs like talking to the customer about the problem, trying to get data, cleaning the data, adjusting the data etc. When finalizing our project, we shouldn’t forget to refer to the problem definition. And we need to show our work with KPI’s, other performance parameters. In conclusion, he recommends us to know what we want to do in this sector, after that we can adjust our work area.\n“Which of the following is the type of dance Baykal Hafızoğlu’s danced?
